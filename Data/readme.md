### This folder contains all the data needed for this project

Due to space limitations on GitHub, the datafiles are all uploaded on a drive link and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13qJRIyYjPHo4uV6W_nTcSueik1ZMsRoi?usp=sharing).

To keep the repo light, the interim data folder contains only the train and test data in csv format, so that it can be downloaded seperately and viewed. All the other data, in csv, pickle and parquet formats can be found in the aforementioned link.
